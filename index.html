            <h2>Why luxury fashion brands?</h2>
            <h3>The Elite, The Value, The Quality</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to fashion brands, we all know fast fashion brands
              like Zara, H&M, Shein, ASOS, etc. On the other hands, there is
              also the luxury fashion. Luxury fashion brands have been talked
              about all the world, and the reason why luxury fashion has been in
              the markey for centuries is because of the quality, the
              exclusivity and thr status.
            </p>

            <p>
              But why should you care about luxury fashion? It is the quality
              and the craftsmanship that comes with each item. Perhaps you will
              use that fast fashion t-shirt 10+ times until it is worn out, that
              is okay. However, a sweater that costs $30 might work as well as a
              sweater from Hermes that costs nearly 10 times more, but it is the
              quality and the craftsmanship that cannot be compared. Final
              thought, luxury fashion is not for everyone, but once you go that
              route, it is difficult to get out.
